1. Select the "**MORE SETTINGS**" drop-down menu on the left side of the router management portal (located at [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) if the router was configured using the files in the [RouterBackups](RouterBackups/) folder.

2. Select "**Advanced**" from the drop-down meny.

3. A new tab will open and present the login screen for the Open-WRT settings management portal. Login to the `root` account with the same password that you use to login to the router's main admin portal. 

4. Hover over the "**System**" drop-down menu and click the "**Backup / Flash Firmware**" option from the list. 

5. Here you can either (a) backup the current configuration, or (b) restore to a previously backed-up configuration. 
a. Under the "**Backup**" section of the page, click the "**Generate archive**" button. A new backup will be made that you are able to save on your local machine. 
b. Under the "**Restore**" section of the page, click the "**Choose file**" and upload the archive file that you wish to restore the router to. Next, click the "**Upload archive...**" button to complete the router restore process.
