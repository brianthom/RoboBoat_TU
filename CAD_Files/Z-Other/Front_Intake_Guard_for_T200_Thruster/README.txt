Reinforced Easy Print Front Intake Guards for Blue Robotics T100 and T200 thrusters by piercet is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

This is an update of my printable Blue Robotics Thruster intake guards for use with the T100 and T200 thrusters. 

The origional guard offers slightly less drag, but is weaker and more difficult to print. These guards are strong, can be printed without support and are fully open source (additional source files available, just let me know what you need) 

These 4 files were were commissioned and sponsored by the fine folks at Seafloor Systems, Incorporated http://seafloorsystems.com/ and were concieved of as an open source update to the origional designs, to benifit the ROV and boating community. Feel free to take a look at their website, they have some neat stuff there! 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: LulzBot
Printer: TAZ 5
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.5mm nozzle at 0.35mm layers, but really anything should be fine. Printed in ABS
Infill: 85% or better

Notes: 
These print sitting flat on the bed. The flat layer, no edge one is probably going to be the simplest to print, but offers the least protection. File 2d is closest to my origional intake guard design. 

# Post-Printing

## Instructions:

To use, remove the 2 M3 metric bolts that hold the nose cone to the thruster, and slip this in place, then reattach using the stock screws. If you print this in ABS it should be fine down to at least 300 feet or so, posibly deeper if you coat it with epoxy paint.
